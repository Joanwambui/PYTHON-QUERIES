Using a Python virtual environment
Creating and using a virtual environment is a straightforward process.
To create a virtual environment, open your terminal and navigate to your project's directory. Then, run the following command:

python -m venv myenv

This command creates a virtual environment named "myenv" in your project directory.
To activate the virtual environment, use the appropriate command for your operating system:

On Windows:

myenv\Scripts\activate

On macOS and Linux:

myenv/bin/activate

Once activated, your terminal prompt will change, indicating that you are now working within the virtual environment.
                                                                                                                                                    
You can now install packages using pip just like you normally would.
Use requirements files: To document and manage your project's dependencies, create a requirements.txt file. This file lists all the libraries and their versions.
You can generate it using pip freeze > requirements.txt and later install them in a new environment using pip install -r requirements.txt.
