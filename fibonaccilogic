A Fibonacci sequence of order n is an integer sequence in which each element is the sum of the previous n elements, except for the first n elements which are {0, 0, 0, ... 0, 1}.
Meaning:
If order is 3, then the sequence will be:
0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, ...

Output the first numbers numbers of the Fibonacci sequence of order order.

Example:
If numbers is 7 and order is 4, output:
0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4
Input
Line 1: An integer numbers for the amount of numbers
Line 2: An integer order for the number of previous numbers you need to calculate the sum of.
Output
The first numbers of the different Fibonacci.
Constraints
3 ≤ numbers ≤ 15
1 ≤ order ≤ 10
Example
Input
7
4
Output
0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4

n = int(input())
o = int(input())
F=[0]*(o-1)+[1]
while len(F)<n:F+=sum(F[-o:]),
