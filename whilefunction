N = 999
9+9+9 = 27
2+7 = 9

Output is 9.



import sys
import math

# Auto-generated code below aims at helping you parse
# the standard input according to the problem statement.

n = int(input())

# Write an answer using print
# To debug: print("Debug messages...", file=sys.stderr, flush=True)
while n > 9:
    n = sum(int(i) for i in str(n))
print(n)
