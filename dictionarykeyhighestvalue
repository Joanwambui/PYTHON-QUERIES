students = {"Alice": 85, "Bob": 92, "Charlie": 78}
top_student = max(students, key=students.get)
print(top_student)

students.get tells Python to look at the scores when comparing.

max() then finds the key (name) that has the largest value (score)

Use max(dictionary, key=dictionary.get) to get the key with the highest value
