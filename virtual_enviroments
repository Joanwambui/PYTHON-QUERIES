Activating/Creating virtual environments

Create a virtual environment by:
To create a virtual environment, navigate to your project
 directory in a command prompt or terminal and run the
 following command:
 ```bash
 python -m venv venv_name
 ```
 Substitute `venv_name` with the preferred name for your
 virtual environment. Activate the virtual environment by
 executing the suitable command for your operating system:- On Windows:
 ```bash
 venv_name\Scripts\activate
 ```- On macOS/Linux:
 ```bash
 source venv_name/bin/activate
 ```
 Once activated, you'll see the virtual environment name in
 your command prompt or terminal, indicating that you're
 working within the virtual environment
