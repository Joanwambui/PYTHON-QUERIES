l=input()
print(int(sum([ord(l[i])for i in range(len(l))])**0.5))

You get a a line of a String and you have to convert the characters of the line to their ASCII number and take the sum of these.
After this step, you take the square-root of the sum and round down, if needed.
import math

# Get the input line
line = input()

# Convert each character to its ASCII value and sum them
ascii_sum = sum(ord(char) for char in line)

# Calculate the square root of the sum
square_root = math.sqrt(ascii_sum)

# Round down the square root
rounded_square_root = math.floor(square_root)

# Print the result
print(rounded_square_root)
