#Task 1: Average daily temperatures
Write a function that takes a list of numbers representing daily temperatures in degrees Celsius
and returns the number of days when the temperature was above the average.

temperature = [20, 22, 24, 19, 25, 21]
sum = 0
count = 0
numberofdays = 0


for i in temperature:
    sum += i
    count += 1
    if i > (sum/count):
        numberofdays += 1

print(numberofdays)
